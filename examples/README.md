# n-vector examples
This folder contains some of the examples as explained on the
[nvector page](http://www.navlab.net/nvector/). Not all examples are completely
identical. In some places more Rust like functions are used to perform the same
operation and in others there are no equivalent operation that can be performed
with this library yet.

The examples illustrates how to perform a lot of different operations with
`n-vectors` which might not always be the desired format. The examples are
included both to illustrate how to use this library as well as to show that
using `n-vectors` in Rust is possible. This also makes it possible to compare
the different `n-vector` implementations.
